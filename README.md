Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for Laboratory 4 assignment in Computer Science 311.

## Summary
This laboratory assignment invites you to work in groups of teams to implement a
multi-drone task completion technique for a specific application using `pyparrot`
Python interface. You are also responsible for writing a detailed report,
stored in the file `writing/reflection.md`. This is a Markdown file that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax

the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment.

## Learning
